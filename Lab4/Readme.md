## Objective
The objective of this lab is to define and use packet subclasses in a programming context.

## Create Packet Sub-classes
1. **`psingle` Subclass:**
   - Constraint: Target has only a one-bit set.

2. **`pmulticast` Subclass:**
   - Constraint: Target has 2-3 bits set.

3. **`pbroadcast` Subclass:**
   - Constraint: Target has all bits set.

## Testing Packet Sub-classes
- Utilize a `foreach` loop to randomly create instances of the packet subclasses.
- Use another `foreach` loop to print each array element.
